## Implementations

Here I will list all possible implementations made by me or the community. The first possible implementation is done in this repository to test all phases and will be the reference implementation for StrexLang.

### 1. Reference implementation

**Done by:** [Me](https://github.com/MartinHelmut)

The reference implementation is the implementation all tests are developed against. To reduce complexity and time it takes it is done via [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org/). The peg-file for the language definition can be found here: https://github.com/MartinHelmut/strex-lang/blob/master/src/strex-lang.peg

### 2. Maybe you?

Fork this repository and implement your own parser from scratch.
