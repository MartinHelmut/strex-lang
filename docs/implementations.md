## Implementations

Here is a list of all implementations made. The first possible implementation is done in this repository to test all phases and will be the reference implementation for StrexLang.

### 1. Reference implementation

**Done by:** [Me](https://github.com/MartinHelmut)

The reference implementation is the one all tests are developed against. To reduce complexity and time it takes it is done via [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org/). The peg-file for the language definition can be found here: https://github.com/MartinHelmut/strex-lang/blob/master/src/strex-lang.peg

### 2. Maybe you?

Fork this repository and implement your own parser from scratch.
